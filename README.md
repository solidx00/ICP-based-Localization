# ICP-based Localization

ðŸ“Œ Localizer2D - Robot Localization using ICP in ROS

Localizer2D is a robot localization system based on ICP (Iterative Closest Point) developed in ROS (Robot Operating System).
It uses laser scanner data and a map to estimate the robot's position in a probabilistic way.

âœ… ICP (Iterative Closest Point) for scan-to-map alignment.
âœ… KD-Tree for fast obstacle search.
âœ… ROS Publisher/Subscriber for real-time communication.
âœ… RViz support for visualization.
